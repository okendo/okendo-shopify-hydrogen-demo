# Demo store for the Okendo Hydrogen components

Please read the [documentation of the `@okendo/shopify-hydrogen` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okendo/shopify-hydrogen).

This demo store is simply the `demo-store` template [provided by Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/getting-started/quickstart), to which the Okendo components have been added. You can look at the commit history to see exactly what changes have been made.

## Requirements

- Your store must be running Okendo Widget Plus â€“ our newer widget offering. Upgrading is free.
- Node.js version `18.0.0` or higher.

## Start the demo store locally

You will need to create a `.env` file with the following values from your Hydrogen instance:

```
SESSION_SECRET=
PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN=
PRIVATE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=
PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_ID=
PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_URL=
PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=
PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_ID=
```

Replace `'<your-okendo-subscriber-id>'` in `app/root.tsx` with your Okendo subscriber ID.

Your Okendo User ID identifies your Okendo account. You can get this information from the Okendo section in the integration settings of the Okendo app.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```
